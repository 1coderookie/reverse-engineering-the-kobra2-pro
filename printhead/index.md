# The printhead

(If you want nice photos of the printhead, [Kobra pro 2 insights prinhead page](https://1coderookie.github.io/Kobra2ProInsights/hardware/printhead/) has a lot!)

The new printhead is used in the Kobra 2 Pro, Plus and Max, and contains the following inside:
* A 6-wire stepper (center taps not connected to motherboard). Model is marked as **42SHDB0066Z-10WD** connected to a direct drive system.
* A 100k NTC Thermistor.
* A 24V 60W heater cartridge
* An anycubic custom heater block. Is styled as a volcano, but is not compatible. There's a 40mm PTFE tube for the heatbreak, and comes with a silicone sock.
* Two 24V fans. The heatsink fan is 30x30x10, the part cooling fan is 50x50x20.
* An induction sensor for automatic bed leveling
* A distribution board that also contains an accelerometer. Is the same accelerometer that the bed uses and judging from the pinout seems to be a WSEN-ITDS or clone.
